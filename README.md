# Smart-Contract

Assignments from <b>Blockchain</b> course.<br>
There are two smart contracts:

## BlindAuction.sol

This smart contract implements <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction">Vickrey auction</a>.<br>
Most of the code is taken from <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/solidity-by-example.html#id2">Soldity by Example</a> in blind auction.<br>
I modified the code to support the Vickrey auction.
